## Why Building Games on NEAR?

#### 1. Fast and Scalable

NEAR’s [sharded infrastructure](https://near.org/papers/nightshade/) make it possible to scale infinitely. The transactions like transfer can be completed instantly on NEAR, and with very low gas fees.

The real-time transaction, low gas fee and high scalability makes it possible to launch world-class game with millions of users.

#### 2. Great User Experience

The NEAR Account and Keys model, Wallet and APIs make it easy to build games with great user experience on NEAR.

The [NEAR account](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account) is human readable, which makes it able to be used directly for roles in games.

The [Function Call Keys](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account#function-call-keys) make it possible to create secure keys with restricted access.

With the help of NEAR's function call key, web wallet and near APIs, it's quite easy to integrate NEAR with game engines or your web/mobile frontend, and user don't have to install browser extensions to launch the game in web or mobile app.

The progressive onboarding process makes it quite easy for users to create a new account using email or SMS, without the necessity of learning about the concepts of seed phrases, gas fees, etc.

#### 3. Developer Friendly

With NEAR, developers can build smart contracts with common languages that they're already familiar with, such as [Rust](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro), [TypeScript](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/as/intro), or build with [Solidity on Aurora](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/eth/evm) if they prefer EVM toolings.

Developers can also build the games with NEAR libraries in [JavaScript](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/front-end/near-api-js), Python, or APIs integrated with game frameworks such as Unity, Godot.

Also, 30% of the gas fees spent on the contracts will be paid to developers.

#### 4. Cross-Chain Interoperability

Assets including FTs / NFTs can be bridged to Ethereum efficiently and easily with the help of [Rainbow Bridge](https://near.org/bridge/).
